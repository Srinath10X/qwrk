# What is Qwrk?

**Qwrk** is a tiny, fast, and reactive JavaScript micro-framework that gives you full control over UI reactivity without a virtual DOM or heavy abstractions.

It’s not a UI library like React or Vue it’s a lightweight reactive core that lets you:

Heavily inspired by [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

- Create **reactive state**
- Respond to **state changes with effects**
- Build elements directly with **low-level primitives**

Think of it as the foundation of a UI engine — built for hackers, minimalists, and those who want raw power and speed in their hands.

If you're tired of bloated frameworks and want to **build your own UI logic from the ground up**, Qwrk gives you the core tools to do it.
